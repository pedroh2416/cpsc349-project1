<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>This website displays a collection of photos taken by professional photographers. The content of these photos
    are pictures of pets, ranging from dogs to rabbits. 
</p>
<p>We were able to implement a background color change, dependent on the picture of the pet.
    <br>
    We added a pagintation feature where users can click on a previous or next page to view more links to photos.
    <br>
    This feature is helpful because you do not have to scroll all the way down to view more photos, instead only 10 urls are presented at a time.
